:abstract: There are several open game systems out there, but in fact their are
	too simple or to complicated to match the needs of a computer games.
	Thus, I decided to make my own roleplay system. Which is described in
	this document.

Motivation
==========
As mentioned in the abstract, their are a lot of game systems describing game
mechanics and in most cases they describe the set and setting of the game. This
is a real restrictive approach. This game system tries to break this leashes and
establish a straight forward, easu to use and reusable set of rules, so you can
do what ever you want with it to create your own world.

Well, this might be a long shot, but you may give it a try. Requests,
suggestions and contributions are welcome to my `mail address`_
